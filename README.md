# Arduino Engineering Lab

This repository contains a collection of practical Arduino engineering projects and exercises designed to explore various aspects of embedded systems. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including sensors, wireless communication, actuators, and data visualisation.

The exercises are structured to provide hands-on experience with key embedded systems concepts, such as reading data from sensors (e.g., temperature, light, air quality), controlling actuators like servo motors, and transmitting data wirelessly using modules like Bluetooth (HC-05) and NRF24L01.

Additionally, the data collected from these exercises is visualised in real-time using Python, making it easier to analyse and monitor the system's behaviour.

**NOTE**: it is assumed that you have access to a computer with all the required software installed.

## List of Exercises

This repository contains solutions to various practical lab exercises using **Arduino**. Each exercise is designed to introduce different concepts and components, allowing you to build and experiment with embedded systems.
The source code is well-commented and easy to follow. A basic understanding of **C/C++** for Arduino programming and **Python** (where applicable) is recommended for a better learning experience.

- [exercise 00](./ex00): turn the built-in led on and off
- [exercise 01](./ex01): turn an external LED on and off
- [exercise 02](./ex02): making use of array to turn a series of LEDs on and off
- [exercise 03](./ex03): measure the temperature using a TMP36 sensor
- [exercise 04](./ex04): send and receive data wirelessly using a Bluetooth module (HC-05)
